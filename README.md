# GCDinCPP
Graphical Display Calculator made using C++ and prints corresponding Graph in an Excel sheet
Its a small project made in C++ initially in Turbo C++.

It has many options for Graphing different Functions:
1.Linear Equations
2.Quadratic Equations
3.Cubic Equations
4.Modulus Function
5.Ceiling Function
6.Square Root Function
7.Reciprocal Function
8.Exponential Function
9.Inverse Square Function
10.Logarithm Function
11.Sine Function
12.Tangent Function

It also has a provision to clear all the graphs from the sheet and an Exit function too.

It uses data file handling Concepts to plot points in the sheet.
